# TravelNest Project Reflection Report

For my Bootstrap 5 UI Internship task, I created a simple, creative travel website called "TravelNest" with three main pages: Home, About, and Contact. Here’s how I approached the project and what I learned:

**Step-by-step Creation:**
- I started by planning the structure: a consistent navbar, footer, and responsive layout for all pages. I used Bootstrap 5 CDN links for easy setup and ensured all code was clean and beginner-friendly.
- On the Home page, I designed a hero section with a gradient background, a welcoming heading, and a call-to-action button. I added three feature cards to highlight the main services, using Bootstrap’s card and grid system for responsiveness.
- The About page introduces TravelNest and explains its mission. I included three cards to showcase the company’s strengths (Expert Guides, Flexible Plans, Trusted Support), keeping the layout and colors consistent with the Home page.
- For the Contact page, I created a centered form with Name, Email, and Message fields, styled with Bootstrap form classes and custom rounded corners. The form is easy to use on any device.

**Bootstrap Components Used:**
- Navbar, Container, Grid (Row/Col), Cards, Buttons, Forms, and Utility classes for spacing, colors, and responsiveness.
- I added custom CSS for creative touches: card hover animations, gradient backgrounds, rounded corners, and smooth scrolling.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Ensuring a consistent color scheme and style across all pages.
- Making the site look creative but still simple and readable for beginners.
- Keeping the layout responsive and visually balanced on all devices.

**What I Learned:**
- How to structure HTML for multi-page sites and link them properly.
- Using Bootstrap 5 to quickly build modern, responsive layouts.
- The importance of consistency, accessibility, and clean code.
- How small creative touches (like gradients and animations) can make a student project stand out.

Overall, this project helped me understand Bootstrap’s power and how to build attractive, user-friendly websites efficiently.
