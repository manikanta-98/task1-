📚 Learnings & Reflection

“Through this project, I explored Bootstrap 5 and learned how to build responsive pages quickly using its components.
By directly coding layouts (without partials or external images), I focused on understanding grid systems, spacing, and typography.
This improved my ability to create professional designs while keeping the code simple and maintainable.”
